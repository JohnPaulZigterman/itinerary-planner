# Itinerary-planner

## Description
Our project was conceived with the goal of simplifying trip planning for our users. This website leverages the MapQuest API to provide precise user location data and calculate distances between two specified addresses, facilitating route planning. Additionally, we have seamlessly integrated the OpenWeather API to provide up-to-date weather forecasts for the duration of the user's trip, ensuring they are well-prepared for their journey.

In terms of design aesthetics, we used the Pure CSS framework to create an elegant and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall user experience. Our commitment to usability, accuracy, and design excellence underscores our dedication to making travel planning a seamless and enjoyable process for all users

If you possess at least one address, aside from your primary lodging location, the 'Distance Calculation' feature will be displayed at the bottom of the schedule. This functionality allows you to input two distinct addresses, enabling the system to compute the distance between these specified locations accurately and in real-time
